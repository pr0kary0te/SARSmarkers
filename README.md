# SARSmarkers

This is a pipeline written in PERL to produce a minimal set of SNP markers capable of discriminating circulating lineages of SARS-CoV-2. It could equally be applied to a sequence alignent of any other organism but has only been tested with ~40,000 accessions of SARS-CoV-2 (~30 kilobases) and may not scale well to larger datasets.

To run:
1) Download all of the PERL scripts in this repositary along with the example alignment and metadata files into a single directory.
2) Run the pipeline with ./pipeline.pl
